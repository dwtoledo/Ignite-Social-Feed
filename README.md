# @dwtoledo Ignite Feed using React

This project is a simple simulation of a social media feed created using the React library. The objective of the project is to create an interface that displays posts, allowing the user to view and interact with the publications.

The feed is populated with fictional data generated from a set of users, posts, and comments. The interface allows for the creation of new comments, as well as the ability to clap the publications.

The project uses various React features such as components, states and props. Styling is done with CSS modules.
